<h1>Exhaust System Cleaning</h1>
<p>Environmental Exhaust Service, Inc. <strong>(EES)</strong> is a leader in the kitchen exhaust cleaning industry dedicated to the &ldquo;turn-key&rdquo; solution for grease, odor and smoke control. We have being serving the Houston community and its surrounding areas since 1996. </p>
<p>More than a decade later our high standards, great customer service and vast experience in the kitchen exhaust cleaning industry has made us a recognized and leading authority  in  Houston  by the industry  as  a  true  specialist  on  complete  commercial  kitchen cleaning.</p>
<p>A proper commercial grease exhaust system cleaning includes cleaning the grease exhaust fan, the grease duct, the hood plenum, the interior of the hood, the grease trays, the grease cups, and grease filters.</p>
<p>We also install and repair whole or partial exhaust systems. Since all exhaust systems are not created equally we clean every particular system according to its unique necessities. We also take the time to help our customers with any findings of deficiencies they may unknowingly have or we will recommended any needed service in <img style="float:right;"  src="images/hood-cleaning2.png" alt="Cleaning a Hood">or around their kitchen exhaust system even at the time of the estimate. We are not only a cleaning company to our customers but we have been helping them with recommendations of service and finding of deficiencies that could have lead to a fire or closure by a health department or fire marshal keeping an operational establishment.</p>
<p>Strict quality control is always maintained to ensure a thorough cleaning of your hood exhaust system, and this is something that we take pride on.</p>
<h1>Our Method</h1>
<p>We use a common non-steam method of cleaning an exhaust system, which consist in using a strong degreaser sprayed onto the walls of the exhaust system followed by scraping off of the grease with special tools made for the job. This is an effective and economic method of achieving a &ldquo;bare metal&rdquo; cleaned system, which is the required standard given by the fire department.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is that &ldquo;If the non-steam method meets the level of cleaning required by the state, then why should you use a more expensive method?&rdquo;</p>
