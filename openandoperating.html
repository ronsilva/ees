<div id="left-text-2"><p>Every year the restaurant industry loses millions of dollars, risk lives and cost tens of thousands of jobs due to fires. Dirty, greasy exhaust systems can pose a serious hazard. Regarding the type of filter or system that you have they simply cannot eliminate by themselves all the vaporized grease that can be produced in a commercial kitchen.</p>
  <p>According to the National Fire Protection Association, the majority of restaurant fires originate on the kitchen cooking appliances and flare into the kitchen exhaust system. Regular maintenance of a restaurant's kitchen exhaust system is one of the primary defenses against fire hazards.</p>
  <p>Keeping your kitchen meticulously clean not only will comply with the Health and Safety regulations and requirements, but by making sure your extraction system is spotless you will also lower your insurance systems and cost. At EES all of our work is in accordance with Code 96 of the National Fire Protection Association. NFPA 96 is the definitive standard on fire protection for all aspects of commercial cooking operations. Requirements cover cooking equipment, hoods, grease removal devices, exhaust duct systems, fans, fire suppression systems, and clearance to combustibles.</p>
  <p>How often you should get your extraction system cleaned, will depend on the size of the kitchen, volume of grease accumulation, and type of cooking. We offer cleaning services according to your needs; these could go from 30 to 180 days.</p>
  <p>As a business you cannot afford to risk not getting your kitchen exhaust system frequently cleaned and inspected. By making it part of your normal monthly or yearly routine, you will definitely reap the benefits.</p>
